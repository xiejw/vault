# vim: shiftwidth=4

impl quicksort.
impl checksum for even folder.

visitor pattern
    ftVisit(visitFn, pre/post_order, void* data)
    typdef error_t (*visitFn) (void* data, struct ft_node*, int* oflag)

    oflag OR based:
      VF_NONE no change
      if_DEATCH: parent is responsbie for deatch this node and maintain the
          sorting order (how to make this efficiency ; copy on write)

functionality to be impl'ed on the visitor pattern
    removeEmptyDir  post order / dettach
    printTree       pre order  / none
    shasum          post order / none
    sotring         port order / none

algo: how to diff two trees
    sorted each sub-tree.
    for each sub-tree, if the shasum is same, it is considered to be identical.
    otherwise, use bisect to find the next item same.
